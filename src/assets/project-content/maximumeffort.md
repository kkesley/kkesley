## Project Introduction
Maximumeffort was a website for a professional gaming team with the same name. The project is divided into 2 parts, the website and an admin system. This is my first project in which I learnt a lot about web development and how to deploy it to a hosting server. Due to some circumstances, the website is no longer available.

#### Website
The website holds information regarding the team, and it provides an interface to register for available tournaments. When visitors are registered for a tournament, they can see their schedules and the tournament's current progress.

#### Admin System
The admin system is used to manage contents for the website including profiles for the entire team and each member of the team. The admin can also create new tournaments which will be reflected in the website. **The website has been brought down and not available for public anymore.**

## Tech Stack
#### Front-End
The front-end of both website and admin system is made with HTML, CSS3, and JQuery. It's made with an existing Bootstrap template which is bought from [themeforest](https://themeforest.net/).
#### Back-End
The back-end of the system is made using plain PHP and MYSQL as the database.
#### Deployment
We deployed the system through a website hosting.

## Key Learning
I developed Maximumeffort from scratch and I learned a lot as this is my first commercial project. The process starts with requirements gathering, producing a demo system, implementing the actual system, and deploying it on the hosting server. I also learnt how painful is it to modify HTML using jQuery without any data binding.
