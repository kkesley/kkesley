## Project Background
This project is an initiative to increase the quality of education in Indonesia. The product of this project is a mobile application for students, parents, and teachers. The project emphasize on transparency between students, parents, and teachers. The system is similar to LMS (but smaller in scope), but is more focusing on getting the information to the parents.

## Tech Stack
#### Admin system
The admin system is included in [Iteacloud](/projects/iteacloud) which is built on React.
#### Application
The application is built using React Native (with Redux) and Expo. The design for the application is designed by a designer from the team. We also used expo for building the application.
#### Back-End
The back-end is an extension of [Iteacloud](/projects/iteacloud). It uses [Iteacloud](/projects/iteacloud) for authentication, and other common functionalities such as sending emails, mobile notifications, and saving user profiles.

## Key Learning
I learned a lot about React Native and its environment (mainly Expo). One important aspect that I learned was about persisting data in the application to achieve instant responsiveness when application is opened. It forces me to think about trade-offs and reevaluate the importance of consistency (especially strong consistency).
