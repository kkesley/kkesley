## Career Background
I was hired as a casual developer in Psych Press while I was studying for my undergraduate and postgraduate degree. I did maximum 20 hours/week while studying and did 40 hours/week on average when I was on my uni break.

## Responsibilities
The first time I got here, I was responsible for maintaining some PHP and ASP websites. I was not familiar with ASP but I managed to fulfill my duty as I learn more about ASP. I also was responsible for creating static demos using plain HTML and CSS.

After a few weeks, I was responsible to create websites using Laravel. This was exciting as I'm new to Laravel. I made some prototypes and APIs using Laravel. While doing that, I also learned how to deploy Laravel websites to EC2 instances using git webhooks.

After a few months, I was curious about AWS and decided to learn about it. Psych Press was really supportive and they provided me a course from [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/). I learned about AWS and its services in one of the courses and I was really excited (and still am!). A few weeks later, we decided to make our move into serverless and I was responsible of making APIs using serverless architecture. I was also responsible of making an entire system with ReactJS which is backed by S3 and Cloudfront, and Lambda, API Gateway, and RDS for the back end. I learned (the hard way) how inefficient it is for lambda in VPC.

I did a lot of things other than development as well such as helping with calls and emails (just a few times), and migrating databases and applications to AWS.
