## Project Background
This project is intended for tax consultants who want to manage their customers using web based system, and is tailored for a client. There are two developers working on this project including me. The other developer was also acting as the project manager. As a bonus, I also learned one or two things about taxation in Indonesia.

## Tech Stack
The web application is built using AngularJS and a Bootstrap template from [themeforest](https://themeforest.net/). We also used Firebase Authentication & Real-Time Database for handling users and data. Therefore, we do not have any back-end system for this project.

### Other
We also used an EC2 Instance which is managed by one of our team members.

## Key Learnings
This is my first time structuring data using a NoSQL database. The learning curve was steep as I oftenly need to restructure the data model. However, it was very worth it and I learned how to produce an efficient schema in NoSQL, which includes techniques such as replication and domain modeling.
