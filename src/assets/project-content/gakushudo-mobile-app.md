## Project Background
This project is an extension of [Iteacup](/projects/iteacup) which is tailored for a specific client. We need to connect the application to [Iteacup's](/projects/iteacup) API. The client is one of the biggest Japanese course providers in Jakarta, Indonesia. This project is made for their students and teachers. Students and teachers can view their schedules, materials, and attendance from the application.

There are 2 developers who were included in this project, and one of them is also acting as a project manager.

## Tech Stack
The application is created with Ionic 2 and connected to [Iteacup's](/projects/iteacup) PHP API. The application is published to Google Play Store.

## Takeaway
This was a fun project and I learned a lot about Ionic 2 and how to extend API functionalities from an existing application.
