## Project Introduction
This is one of the biggest projects that I've had my entire career. The business is running and growing. I've been included from the inception phase until a year after they released the initial version of the website. This project has 2 main parts which are a website and an admin system.

#### Website
The website allows registered visitors to invest to listed properties. Investors can sell or buy shares which are attached to specific properties to other investors or the company itself. Investors can transact using either a direct transfer or using the system's currency. Later on, the properties may be rented or sold, and any revenues will be shared amongst the investors of each property.

Visitors may also view blogs, company profile, FAQs, careers, and core team members which are dynamically generated from the admin system. All content is available in English and Bahasa.

#### Admin System
The admin system manages properties listing and the content of the system. It can also send newsletters to subscribers and view their investors' activities. The system is pretty complex as the requirement grows.

## Tech Stack
#### Front-End
Both the website and the admin system uses AngularJS as the front-end. I used two Bootstrap templates which is bought from [themeforest](https://themeforest.net/).

#### Back-End
The back-end is built using plain PHP with MYSQL as the database.

#### Deployment
The system is deployed to a single EC2 Instance which hold the website, API, and an email server. We used AWS RDS for hosting the database.

## Key Learning
#### Technical
The most challenging part of the system is how to program the market behaviour. There were edge cases which I missed and resulting in a complete rewrite of the program. This project also greatly reinforced my knowledge about web development as I need to handle all development and bug fixings. I was also exposed to some AWS services other than EC2 such as RDS and SES.

#### Management
This project also taught me about how to improve unrealistic requirements and communicate them back to clients. I also learned how to prioritize features for business requirements and negotiate some requirements to achieve their targeted deadline. In overall, I was exposed to the full software development lifecycle which is an unforgettable experience.
