## Project Introduction
Iteacup is an accounting web application which includes general ledger, income statement, inventory management, and other accounting features. Each client would have their own domain with their own database. There are 4 developers who worked on this system and each of us are assigned some parts of the system. As a bonus, I also learned one or two things about accounting and how financial reports relate to each other.

## Tech Stack
#### Front-End
We used AngularJS for the front-end using Bootstrap as the CSS framework.
#### Back-End
The system's API is made using plain PHP and MYSQL as the database.
#### Deployment
The system is deployed to an EC2 Instance which is act as web server, database server, and email server.

## Key Learning
This is the first project which I need to learn how to work as a team. We need to share our knowledge of the system and integrate features made by other team members. I also learned about data binding (using AngularJS) which makes development much easier. Along the way, we often gather together and code to fix bugs / implement new features. The process was fun and rewarding for me.
