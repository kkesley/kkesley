## Project Introduction
CPA Australia is an organization that helps prepare accountants to be a Certified Public Accountant. This software is for an annual competition which is held by CPA Australia in Jakarta, Indonesia for university students. The software's responsibility is to display questions of the competition and record each team's score. This software is used twice in 2015 & 2016.

## Tech Stack
I used Java to build the software with Java Swing for the GUI. There are no complex processing and databases for this software.

## Takeaways
This is a small commercial project in which I'm required to operate the system myself. It's been really fun to work with the committees and the project manager treated me fairly.
