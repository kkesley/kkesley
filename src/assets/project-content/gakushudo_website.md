## Project Introduction
This project is an extension of [Iteacup](/projects/iteacup) which is tailored for a specific client. We need to create a company profile website. The website also serve as an ordering system for students to order books from the company which is connected to [Iteacup's](/projects/iteacup) API. The client is one of the biggest Japanese course providers in Jakarta, Indonesia. The website can be viewed in Bahasa, English, or Japanese.

There are 2 developers who were included in this project, and one of them is also acting as a project manager.

## Tech Stack
The website is built using AngularJS and connected to [Iteacup's](/projects/iteacup) PHP API. We deployed the website to an EC2 instance.

## Takeaway
The project reinforced my experience regarding web development. I was also exposed to localization for the first time which is pretty cool.
