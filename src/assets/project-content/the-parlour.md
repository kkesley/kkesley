## Project Background
This project has a deliverable of a website which includes a company information, services, and products. The client is a hairdresser business, called The Parlour Hairdressing, which are based in two large cities in Indonesia.  **The website has been brought down and not available for public anymore.**

## Tech Stack
The website is a static site built using AngularJS which is deployed to an EC2 instance.

## Key Learning
I worked with a great designer for this project and it was really fun. We have to manage requirements from the client and translate it to system specifications. I learned a lot about communicating with clients and how to translate technical terms to be understood by people who do not have any technical backgrounds. As a bonus, I also learned one or two things regarding web design.
